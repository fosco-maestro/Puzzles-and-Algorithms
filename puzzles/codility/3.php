<?php
//A non-negative integer is called heavy if the average value of its digits in decimal representation exceeds 7. Assume that 0 has an average value of its digits equal to 0.
//
//For example, the number 8,698 is heavy because the average value of its digits is (8+6+9+8)/4 = 7.75. The number 53,141 has an average value of its digits of (5+3+1+4+1)/5 = 2.8, so it is not heavy.
//
//Write a function:
//
//     function heavy_decimal_count($A,$B);
//
//that, given two non-negative integers A and B, returns the number of heavy integers within the interval [A..B] (both ends included).
//
//Assume that:
//
//- A is an integer within the range [0..200,000,000];
//- B is an integer within the range [0..200,000,000];
//- A â‰¤ B.
//
//For example, given A=8,675 and B=8,689 the function should return 5, because there are five heavy integers within the range [8,675..8,689]:
//
//8675    avg=6.50
//8676    avg=6.75
//8677    avg=7.00
//8678    avg=7.25    HEAVY
//8679    avg=7.50    HEAVY
//8680    avg=5.50
//8681    avg=5.75
//8682    avg=6.00
//8683    avg=6.25
//8684    avg=6.50
//8685    avg=6.75
//8686    avg=7.00
//8687    avg=7.25    HEAVY
//8688    avg=7.50    HEAVY
//8689    avg=7.75    HEAVY
//
//Complexity:
//
//- expected worst-case time complexity is O((log( A ) + log( B )) 3);
//- expected worst-case space complexity is O(log( A ) + log( B )).
